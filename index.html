<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as The Web, is an  information
system where documents and other web resources are  identified
by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/),
which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over
the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.
